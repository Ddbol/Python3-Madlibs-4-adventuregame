# Python3-Madlibs-4-adventuregame

Python 3 - Mad Libs Generator:
Inspired by Summer Sonâ€™s Mad Libs project with Javascript. The program prompts the
user for a series of inputs e.g. a noun, an adjective, etc. The program contains a dictionary of different stories. 
After the user input one of these stories is randomly chosen and filled with the relevant user input to print a fun Mad Lib story. 

Python 4 - Text Based Adventure Game: 
This game allows a user to move through several rooms in a preset layout by inputting text directions N/E/S/W or quit with Q. 
The program prints the map and starts the user in a preset area, describes the location and lists the viable direction moves for the user to see.
The user is prompted for input. If it's valid the user moves to a new location, otherwise they get a prompt that they have input an invalid direction or input. 
If a valid move is inputted, the program prints the location and description. 
This loops until the user types Q.
